- When fixing stuff never do workarounds or patchings. always fix stuff the correct way with clean code and DRY principles.
- If you think something could be useful in the future extract it in a reusable component/function
- in FE use apiClient to make requests to be
- In BE use the primary constructor syntax (class Foo(IBar bar))
- Dont keep legacy code.
- I REALLY appreciate clean and reusable code.
