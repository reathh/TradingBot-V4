# Development Workflow

## Running the Application

1. **Backend**:
   - The .NET backend should be started first
   - It runs on port 5025 (based on the frontend proxy configuration)

2. **Frontend**:
   - The Vue.js frontend is configured with Vite
   - Run the frontend dev server using the commands in the frontend directory
   - It will run on port 5001 as configured in [vite.config.js](mdc:frontend/vite.config.js)

## Environment Setup

The application appears to be containerized, as evidenced by the presence of `.dockerignore` at the root level, suggesting Docker can be used for deployment and possibly development.
