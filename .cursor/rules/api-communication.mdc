# API Communication

## Frontend to Backend Communication

The frontend communicates with the backend through API calls. Based on the [vite.config.js](mdc:frontend/vite.config.js), the frontend proxies API requests to the backend server:

```javascript
proxy: {
  "/api": {
    target: "http://localhost:5025",
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, "/api"),
  },
}
```

All API requests from the frontend should be prefixed with `/api` which will be proxied to the backend running on port 5025.

## Backend API Endpoints

The backend exposes API endpoints through controllers in the `backend/TradingBot/Controllers` directory. These controllers handle various trading operations and provide data for the dashboard frontend.
