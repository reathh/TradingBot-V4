# Testing

## Backend Tests

The backend includes a test project in `backend/TradingBot.Tests/` which contains tests for:

- Application commands:
  - `PlaceExitOrders`
  - `PlaceOpeningOrders`
  - `UpdateBotOrder`
  - `UpdateStaleOrders`
  - `VerifyBotBalance`

- Services

These tests validate the core trading logic and service behaviors.
